# Twitter_analysis
This project detects the probability that a tweet was written by a certain person given two people. It uses twitter to collect data and linear regression to create a model that detects the probability that the tweet was written by that person
The model was trained on the data provided by Trump and Hillary.
The model extracts n-grams using n-gram.py. In the project I am also using the feature given by sklearn in order to obtain greater efficiency.
To analyse the data extracted I am using logistic regression.
Given two people the model will tell the probability that the tesc was written by that person.
